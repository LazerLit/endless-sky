			`Amelia is engrossed in some kind of spreadsheet when you barge into her office and drop a datachip of scans from your fight with the Wolf Pack onto her desk. Her brows knit at this breach of protocol but she switches her display to show the data and you watch closely as her eyes widen and the colour drains from her face.`
			`	“Is this… this can’t be right!" she says, flipping back and forth through the images. “Nukes? I... I almost believed them!"`
			`	You remain quiet and let her process what she is seeing. It takes a while and so you make yourself comfortable on a recliner in the corner, just answering the occasional question when she wants a bit more context. Eventually she leans back on her chair shaking her head. You notice that she seems to have aged in the short time you have been here.`
			`	“I need a little time to decide what to do. Please stay nearby, I'm going to need your help.“`
			`	You nod and leave her alone in the office staring at the ceiling and go for a walk around the campus. The grounds of the headquarters buildings have been beautifully landscaped and it isn't difficult to find a nice green, quiet space to think.`
			`	However you had felt about the Free Worlds before, it is clear now that they are worse than terrorists. Their protestations of innocence in the bombings of Geminus and Martini are obviously nothing more than a cynical attempt at political obfuscation. You try to distract yourself with cargo manifests while you wait, but the events of the past few days keep exploding back into your mind. Finally you get a prompt to return to the office where Commander Shah is waiting for you.`
			`	“We can’t make any mistakes here," she says, “this is too important. This has to be passed up to the top, but we need to have the answers to every question that might be asked ready. I’ll talk to Anton but I already know what he’ll say, we need to get the data independently analysed and verified. We can’t risk broadcasting this, the data has to be physically taken to Ada, to Lovelace Labs. The fewer people who are in the loop the better.`
			`	"<first>, you of all people know what is riding on this. Can you deliver the data, and make sure that it gets to the right hands at Lovelace Labs? I can’t send anyone from the Navy without drawing attention."`
			`	You nod, understanding the importance of this task.`
			`	"Good," Amelia says with a sigh of relief. "I'm counting on you to be discreet, I don't need to remind you of the consequences if this information falls into the wrong hands."`

			`	As soon as you land a transport pulls up outside of the hatch of your ship and a small contingent of technicians start unloading equipment, supervised by a man in a generic-looking business suit. The man notices you watching and approaches, pulling out a badge identifying him as an agent of Republic Intelligence.`

			`	As soon as you break atmosphere Agent Norris is at your shoulder.`
			`	"The analysis seems to confirm a Syndicate origin," he says grimly. "There are only a few worlds with plutonium mines where they would have had a chance of avoiding Republic inspectors. Our mission is to get soil samples form each of them."`
			choice
				`	"What if the Syndicate don't want to let us?"`
				`	"Sounds easier said than done."`
			`	"We can't afford any delay here, we need to shut this down before they can build up an arsenal. We will be landing directly at each of the mines and moving on as soon as we have the sample. We will not be asking permission."

				`	"Sounds good to me."`
					goto end
				`	"I don't want to take on the entire syndicate fleet! In my experience ignoring traffic control makes planetary militias trigger-happy."`
			`	"That's why I'm here," Agent Norris says. "We will be carrying out a warrant. The only way they could legally stop us would be to file an injunction with the Supreme Court, and we're not going to give them time to do that."

			`	Your descent to the surface of <destination> is violently bumpy, the turbulence threatening to send the <ship> hurtling out of control. As soon as it becomes clear that you are not heading towards the small landing site, your com system lights up with warnings.`
			`	"Uh, <ship>, please be advised that you are in restricted airspace. Divert to the heading indicated immediately."`
			`	Agent Norris steps calmly forward and presses the button to respond.
			`	"<destination> control," he says, his voice smooth as silk, completely unlike his usual gravelly rumble. "This is <ship>, currently acting on parliamentary orders. I am transmitting a warrant which allows us to act as we see fit. I understand that you will want to check it with your superiors, so be my guest."`
			`	He cuts the comms and then leans over the nav screen, his eyes narrowed as he searches for the mine.`
			`	"There," he says, pointing to a cluster of machinery at the foot of an old lava flow. "Take us in, Captain."`
			`	The <ship> touches down and Agent Norris already has a mask on and the sampling tool in his hand. He jumps out of the hatch before the ramp has even finished extending and then pushes the tool into the ground, where it immediately separates and then seals around a sample. He strides back up the ramp and hits the button to seal the hatch.`
			`	"That's it, Captain," he says as soon as he has taken off the breath mask. "Break atmosphere and we can move on to the next location."`
