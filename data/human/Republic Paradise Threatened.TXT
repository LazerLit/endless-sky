			`Amelia is engrossed in some kind of spreadsheet when you barge into her office and drop a datachip of scans from your fight with the Wolf Pack onto her desk. Her brows knit at this breach of protocol but she switches her display to show the data and you watch closely as her eyes widen and the colour drains from her face.`
			`	"Is this... this can’t be right?!" she says, flipping back and forth through the images. “Nukes? I... I almost believed them!"`
			`	You remain quiet and let her process what she is seeing. It takes a while and so you make yourself comfortable on a recliner in the corner, just answering the occasional question when she wants a bit more context. Eventually she leans back on her chair shaking her head. You notice that she seems to have aged in the short time you have been here.`
			`	"I need a little time to decide what to do. Please stay nearby, I'm going to need your help."`

			`	You nod and leave her alone in the office staring at the ceiling and go for a walk around the campus. The grounds of the headquarters buildings have been beautifully landscaped and it isn't difficult to find a nice green, quiet space to think.`
			`	However you had felt about the Free Worlds before, it is clear now that they are worse than terrorists. Their protestations of innocence in the bombings of Geminus and Martini are obviously nothing more than a cynical attempt at political obfuscation. You try to distract yourself with cargo manifests while you wait, but the events of the past few days keep exploding back into your mind. Finally you get a prompt to return to the office where Commander Shah is waiting for you.`
			`	"We can’t make any mistakes here," she says, "this is too important. It has to be passed up to the top, but we need to have the answers to every question that might be asked ready. I’ll talk to Anton but I already know what he’ll say, we need to get the data independently analysed and verified. We can’t risk broadcasting this, the data has to be physically taken to Lovelace Labs; the fewer people who are in the loop, the better.`
			`	"<first>, you of all people know what is riding on this. Can you deliver the data, and make sure that it gets to the right hands at Lovelace Labs? I can’t send anyone from the Navy without drawing attention."`
			`	You nod, understanding the importance of this task.`
			`	"Good," Amelia says with a sigh of relief. "I'm counting on you to be discreet, I don't need to remind you of the consequences if this information falls into the wrong hands."`

			`As soon as you break atmosphere Agent Norris is at your shoulder.`

			`	"Uh, <ship>, please be advised that you are in restricted airspace. Divert to the heading indicated immediately."`
			`	Agent Norris steps calmly forward and presses the button to respond.
			`	"<destination> control," he says, his voice smooth as silk, completely unlike his usual gravelly rumble. "This is <ship>, currently acting on parliamentary orders. I am transmitting a warrant which allows us to act as we see fit. I understand that you will want to check it with your superiors, so be my guest."`
			`	He cuts the comms and then leans over the nav screen, his eyes narrowed as he searches for the mine.`
			`	"There," he says, pointing to a cluster of machinery at the foot of an old lava flow. "Take us in, Captain."`
			`	The <ship> touches down and Agent Norris already has a mask on and the sampling tool in his hand. He jumps out of the hatch before the ramp has even finished extending and then pushes the tool into the ground, where it immediately separates and then seals around a sample. He strides back up the ramp and hits the button to seal the hatch.`
			`	"That's it, Captain," he says as soon as he has taken off the breath mask. "Break atmosphere and we can move on to the next location."`

			`It is a relief to be back in space where you are significantly less likely to be hit by a lava bomb. Agent Norris calls up the star chart and selects the next destination.`
			`	"<destination> next, Captain," he says. "We should expect a little more pushback this time as the warrant won't be a complete surprise. Don't worry though, they can't get an injunction this quickly."`
			`	"So how quickly can they get one?" you ask. "And how many more systems are we looking at?"`

			`	For the first time since you met him Agent Norris actually smiles, a grim expression which makes you think that he really hopes the worst will happen.`
			`	"Captain <last>," he says, leaning casually against a console. "We will complete this mission. The whole mission, not just the easy parts. The Syndicate are not above the law."`
			`	He nods once and retires to his bunk leaving you to plot the course to <system>, his words still echoing in your head. You think you've seen a fair bit of the galaxy, much more than most of humanity, and in your experience in Syndicate space the Syndicate makes the laws. This will certainly be interesting.`

			`You start your descent, aiming for a small but well-organized settlement in the southern hemisphere. It takes a little longer than usual for spaceport control to contact you, but when they finally do you realize that it's probably because they were getting somebody senior on the line.`
			`	"<ship>, be advised that we have received details of your warrant in advance and we are cooperating fully. You may land and make use of all of the spaceport facilities to refuel your ship, and we can offer you and your crew vouchers for the Starlink Casino and all of our fine bars and restaurants. The Syndicate has nothing to hide."`
			`	Your sigh of relief is short-lived, however, as Agent Norris is shaking his head.`
			`	"They are trying to stall us," he says. "Probably so that they can force their injunction through. Refuel if you need to, but don't let them drag it out any more than necessary."`

			`Agent Norris collects his sample and you make a short hop to the spaceport to refuel.

Soon enough <ship> is fully fueled and you seal the hatch for takeoff.

			`You hop over to the spaceport and as you do so you can see from your scope that there are no pirates left in the system. As before the ground crew seem unusually incompetent, and as before Agent Norris goes outside to deal with it. You take the time to perform some routine maintenance, and then you notice a ruby red laser light shining on one of the consoles. You freeze. Are they goind to try to assassinate you? You're not aware of any handheld munition which could penetrate the armor of your ship but suddenly you wonder what the labs on Hephaestus might have quietly come up with.`

You take that as an 'all clear' and look out your viewport. The ground crew are still working, but there is no sign of Agent Norris. Just to be sure, you open the hatch and take a look around, but the agent is nowhere to be seen.`

			`You make it to the surface, and as you are coming in to land you can see that a small unit of Syndicated Security soldiers are setting up some defences. You screech over them and open up with your weapons, sending them sprawling in all directions.`
			`	Agent Norris retrieves a rifle from his bunk, and when he sees you looking at it he shrugs. "My technicians put it in when they were sweeping the ship."`
			`	As he surges through the hatch, moving faster than any human has a right to, you can't help but wonder what else those technicians were doing. After you drop Norris on Ada, you decide that you'll take some time to sweep <ship> yourself.`
			`	There is the sound of gunfire from outside, and smoke surrounds the ship. Your sensors show four human heat signatures running and bent low but you can't tell which one is Norris. They all seem to be converging on the clear area in front of the mine, but it looks like none of them can see any of the others. You watch as one spins from cover, sweeping his weapon from side to side. Just then, one of the others jerks, lifts from the ground and then falls down dead, all in a flash.`
			`	A second person enters the clearing and then exchanges hand signals with the first. They both start moving in parallel, creeping slowly and each covering their own side. You look for the fourth person and find that he is now lying dead too. Before you can figure out what is going on, the two remaining figures turn and start firing behind them, but what their aiming at is a mystery as nothing shows on your scope. First one and then the other expend their ammo and pause... and then beams of fire erupt from in front of them, taking both down before they have a chance to react.`
			`	When the smoke eventually clears you see Norris calmly toting the sample back towards the ship.`
			`	"Back to Ada, Captain," he says when he is back on board. You are not about to argue with him.`
